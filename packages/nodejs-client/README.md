# WaterlyConnect NodeJS Client

## Required Values

You will need 3 specific values provided by the Waterly team to proceed:

- `url`: The endpoint URL to submit data to
- `clientToken`: The client "secret" for the API client
- `clientDeviceId`: A unique identifier for the API client

---

## Installation

```
yarn add @waterclick/waterlyconnect-nodejs-client
```

---

## Usage

```typescript
import {
  TagDatum,
  WaterlyConnectApiClient,
  WaterlyConnectApiClientConfig
} from "@waterclick/waterlyconnect-nodejs-client";

const config: WaterlyConnectApiClientConfig = {
  url: "https://foo.bar/connect/submit",
  clientToken: "abcpdqxyz123",
  clientDevice: {
    id: "my-fancy-device",
    type: "SCADACo",
  },
};

const c = new WaterlyConnectApiClient(config);

const data: TagDatum[] = [
  // Note that timestamps must be in *seconds* since the epoch, not milliseconds
  { name: "TagName", value: "123.2", last_change_timestamp: Math.floor(new Date().getTime() / 1000) },
];

c.submitData(data)
  .then(() => console.log("Success!"))
  .catch((err) => console.error("Failed to submit data", err));

```

## API

### WaterlyConnectApiClient

#### `constructor`

The `WaterlyConnectApiClient` requires one argument: an object of `WaterlyConnectApiClientConfig`. Please see the type
documentation below for specifics of how it may be configured.

#### `submitData`

`submitData` is an async method with a `void` value. You must resolve calls to function with either `then()/catch()`
syntax or `async/await`.

This function will **throw an error** that you must catch in your code if data was unable to be accepted by the
WaterlyConnect service for any reason,
or will complete silently when successful.
